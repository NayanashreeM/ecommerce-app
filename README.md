   Forever is an e-commerce application built on the MERN tech stack, featuring a user-friendly interface.
   It includes a dedicated Admin Panel, accessible only by admin, for managing product delivery updates,
   adding new items to the website, and tracking order details. The application employs JWT for authentication and authorization, 
   ensuring secure access. Comprehensive error handling is implemented on both the backend and frontend. 
   Users can easily create an account by providing basic information and can then start shopping for their
   desired clothing items using various filters before placing orders.
